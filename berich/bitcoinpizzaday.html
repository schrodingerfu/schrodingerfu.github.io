        I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!<br />
        <br />
        I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.<br />
        <br />
        If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.<br />
        <br />
        Thanks,<br />
        Laszlo

    <p>Has Jeremy Sturdivant (Jercos) been a millioniare? Here is an <a href="http://bitcoinwhoswho.com/index/jercosinterview" target="_blank">interview</a> with Jercos five years later.</p>

    <div style="margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;"><b>Q</b>: What do you primarily use bitcoins for? Do you still control millions of dollars worth?<br />
        <br />
        <b>A</b>: Bitcoin as a currency is meant to be spent. Those 10,000 BTC made it back into the economy fairly quickly, around the time they were worth some $400.
