    <p><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz" target="_blank">Bitcoin Pizza Day</a>: On May 17, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz posted a request to buy pizza with bitcoin. It was on May 22 that he reported successfully trading 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, with Jeremy Sturdivant ordering the pizza and receiving the coins.</p>
    <div style="margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;">￼I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!<br />
    <br />
    I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.<br />
    <br />
    If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.<br />
    <br />
    Thanks,<br />
    Laszlo</div>
